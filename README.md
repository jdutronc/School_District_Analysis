# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The Chief Data Scientist for the City School District, Maria, has tasked us with looking into performance trends and patterns of over 39,000 students out of 15 district and charter schools to inform startegic decisions at the school district level.
We have created:
- a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
- an overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
- tables presenting top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, average math and reading scores per grade and per school, and school performance based on the budget per student, school size and type of school.
Now the School Board has notified Maria that the source data we bsed our analysis on shows evidence of academic dishonesty at Thomas High School. We have to replace math and reading grades for all ninth graders at THS with NaNs and run our analysis again.
